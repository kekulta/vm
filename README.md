# JVM

This is my toy implementation of the JVM. Currently it can run only HelloWorld
and not any HelloWorld but specially crafted, because I stil can't figure out
how work properly with the IO.

It also lacks any return types, exceptions and it recognizes like 4 opcodes.
Code base is a mess, but its my mess and I love it!
